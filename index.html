    <p>The Journey</p>
    <p>neural data needs to make more sense. working on making biologically plausible models. neural data is a massive clutch i have as a ground source reference. catastrophic forgetting isn't bypassed yet. energy based models and manifolds ftw.</p>
    <p>starting to realise how much dev work is needed for science. appreciator of opensource.</p>
    <p>EV grant winner for presenting work at <a href="https://2024.ccneuro.org/">CCN, 2024</a></p>
